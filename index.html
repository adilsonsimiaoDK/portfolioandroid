        <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>
        <p>
          You probably know that the operating system
          <strong>Android</strong>, maintained by Google, is one of the most
          used for mobile devices worldwide. But perhaps you didn’t know that
          its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? So follow
          this article to learn a lot about it.
        </p>
        <h2>The first version</h2>
        <p>
          The first attempt to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and came from a
          developer named
          <a
            href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
            class="external"
          >
            Dan Morrill</a
          >. He says he opened
          <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (free software for image
          vectorization) and created his own robot version. The goal was just to
          personify the system for his team; there was no company request to
          create a mascot.
        </p>

          <img src="imagens/dan-droids.png" alt="Primeiro mascote do Android" />
        </picture>
        <p>
          This bizarre first version was even named in honor of its creator:
          they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>A new mascot emerges</h2>
        <p>
          The idea of having a mascot matured, and the task was handed over to a
          professional in the field. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a
          Google employee, took on the mission of representing the little robot
          in a more pleasant way.
        </p>

            media="(max-width:700px)"
            srcset="../assets/imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
          />
          <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina foto" />

        <p>
          The main idea of
          <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" class="external"
            >Irina Blok</a
          >
          was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a
          flatter style. The design also needed to generate quick identification
          with whoever saw it. Thus, Bugdroid, the new Android mascot, was born.
        </p>
        <figure class="bugdroid">
          <img
            src="imagens/bugdroid.png"
            alt="mascote oficial do android"
            loading="lazy"
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid’s design came from those
          little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate gender.
          Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in Google’s
          office, looked toward the bathrooms, and the identification was
          immediate: simple, clean, objective.

            Another curious fact about Android is that each version has always
            been named after a dessert, following alphabetical order from
            version 1.5 to 9.0.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Bolo de copo"> Cupcake</abbr></li>
            <li>1.6 - <abbr title="Rosquinha">Donut</abbr></li>
            <li>2.0 - <abbr title="Bomba">Eclair</abbr></li>
            <li>2.2 - <abbr title="Iogurte congelado">Froyo</abbr></li>
            <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Biscoito de Gengibe">Gingerbread</abbr></li>
            <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Favo de Mel">Honeycomb</abbr></li>
            <li>
              4.0 - <abbr title="Sanduiche de Sorvete">Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr>
            </li>
            <li>4.1 - <abbr title="Jujuba">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
            <li>4.4 - <abbr title="KitKat">KitKat</abbr></li>

            <li>9.0 - <abbr title="Torta">Pie</abbr></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, <abbr title="Android 10">Android Q</abbr> didn’t
            exist, as Google decided to end this fun practice.
